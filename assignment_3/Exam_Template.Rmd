# Instructions to students

You should only use the file Exam_template.Rmd provided on blackboard and you should load this file from your scripts folder / directory.

Save this template as your studentID.Rmd; you will upload this file as your submission. Change the information on line 3 of this file – changing the author information to your **student ID**. Do not change the authorship to your name.

Ensure that you save your data into your data folder (as discussed in class). You may use the files mypackages.R and helperFunctions.R from blackboard. If you use these files, do not alter them. If you wish to create additional files for custom functions that you have prepared in advance, make sure that you upload these in addition to your .Rmd file and your compiled output file.

Your should knit this file to a document **Word** format.

Any changes that you make to the data (e.g. variable name changes) should be made entirely within R.

The subsubsections labelled **Answer:** indicate where you should put in your written Answers. The template also provides blank code chunks for you to complete your Answers; you may choose to add additional chunks if required.

# Data description


This dataset is part of a larger dataset that has been collected to help to estimate the price of used cars.

It contains the following variables:

- brand (manufacturer)
- model (of car)
- year (of registration of the car)
- price (in GB pounds)
- transmission (type of gearbox)
- mileage (total distance covered by the car)
- fuelType (type of fuel used by the car)
- tax (annual cost of vehicle tax)
- mpg (miles per gallon - a measure of fuel efficiency)
- engineSize (size of the engine in litres)



# Question 1: Data Preparation (11 marks)

You are interested in modelling the price of vehicles that have all of the following properties:

- mileage less than 60000
- Manual transmission
- Petrol engine (fuelType)
- Costing less than £200 in annual Vehicle Tax.

Once you have selected the rows of data with these properties, then you must *use your studentID* to select a random sample of 2000 rows of the data to perform the rest of your analysis with.

You should remove any redundant variables (where only one value remains in that variable).

This subset of the data is what you should use for the rest of this assessment. 


a. Explain what data preparation is required in order for the data in Jan_2022_Exam_Data.csv to be suitable for this analysis.

Write a short report of 300-500 words for the client. 

Furthermore, include an explanation as to which model you would recommend, and why you have selected that model. 

Comment on any suggestions for alterations to the model that would be appropriate to consider.
